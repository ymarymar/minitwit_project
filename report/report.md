# Systems Perspective

A description and illustration of the:

## Design and architecture of your ITU-MiniTwit systems.

Minitwit is a Twitter clone built with a Svelte frontend, a Java (Javalin) REST backend, and a PostgreSQL database. All the involved applications are containerized with Docker and deployed on DigitalOcean infrastructure using Docker Swarm for orchestration. Infrastructure provisioning is handled by OpenTofu (opensource fork of TerraForm) and Ansible, and the monitoring stack consists of Prometheus, Grafana, Loki and Grafana Alloy.

### Infrastructure Architecture

![Request flow](diagrams/Minitwit%20-%20Request%20flow.png)

Our system runs across five DigitalOcean droplets as illustrated in the above figure. Three manager-worker swarm nodes form the application cluster, one dedicated droplet hosts the PostgreSQL database, and one dedicated droplet hosts the monitoring stack. 

Docker Swarm manages container orchestration across the three nodes, running three replicas each of nginx, the Java backend and the Svelte frontend. The routing mesh ensures any node can handle any request regardless of which node the container is actually running on. In order to keep eyes on these droplets, monitoring was deployed. 

A DigitalOcean load balancer sits in front of the three swarm nodes, handling SSL termination via a Let's Encrypt certificate and distributing incoming traffic across the swarm. Each swarm node runs nginx as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate container based on the URL path — /api, /web, /swagger and /openapi route to the Java backend on port 7070, all other traffic goes to the Svelte frontend on port 80, and /grafana proxies across the private network to Grafana on the monitoring droplet. All cross-droplet communication outside the Swarm overlay network uses DigitalOcean's private network, such as connections from the swarm nodes to the database and monitoring droplets. Both the database and monitoring droplets have a DigitalOcean block storage volume attached, ensuring data persists across droplet recreations.


### Monitoring Architecture

![Monitoring flow](diagrams/Minitwit%20-%20Monitoring%20flow.png)

Grafana Alloy runs on all the droplets, collecting logs of all the containers on each droplet and shipping them to Loki on the monitoring droplet. Prometheus scrapes metrics from the Java backend (/metrics) and node exporter on each node every 15 seconds. Grafana provides a unified dashboard querying both Prometheus and Loki. Node exporter exposes system-level metrics about the host machine, like CPU usage, memory, disk I/O and network traffic that prometheus can scrape and pass to Grafana for visualization.

### Application Architecture

![Application architecture](diagrams/Minitwit%20-%20Component%20diagram.png)

The backend follows a three-layer architecture as illustrated in the above diagram. The API layer is split into two distinct entry points:

- the Web API (/web/*) serving the Svelte frontend with JWT-based authentication
- the Simulator API (/api/*) serving the course simulator with HTTP Basic Auth

Controllers handle incoming requests and pass the work to the services which are divided up into four different domains: authentication, users, messages and timeline. These services contain the core business logic of the Minitwit application. To read and write data, the services rely on three repositories — user, message, and follower — each responsible for interacting with its corresponding table in the database

We applied this architecture because it enforces separation of concerns and encourages adherence to the single responsibility principle, as controllers handle only HTTP routing, services contain only business logic, and repositories handle only data access. This allowed us to use the same business logic for both the simulator and the Web API without duplicating code. The separation also made the code more maintainable. Migrating to an ORM was straightforward, as all SQL code was already isolated within the repository layer

### Infrastructure as code

The entire infrastructure is provisioned through code. OpenTofu provisions the DigitalOcean droplets and volumes, while Ansible handles the configuration of the VMs created by OpenTofu. Ansible executes five playbooks in sequence: base setup, Swarm initialization, database configuration, monitoring setup and application deployment. A single provision.sh script runs the full provisioning sequence from scratch. Both tools are designed to be idempotent, meaning the scripts can safely be rerun if anything fails during the process.

## Technology & System choice 

Java was chosen as the backend language due to the team's prior familiarity with it. For the web framework we chose Javalin, a lightweight alternative to larger frameworks like Spring Boot (this was a consideration in terms of the scope of the project in general). This also means it requires far less configuration and setup, which suited the scope of having 5 nodes in total.

For container orchestration we used Docker Swarm rather than Kubernetes. Swarm is simpler to operate and sufficient for the scale of this project. The group did also consider Kubernetes but this was scraped due to complexity. For cloud hosting, we chose DigitalOcean due to available credits through GitHub Education and its recommendation within the course. The group could have gone with self-hosting, but the consequence of doing so would have been introducing more managing. The group therefore decided to use DigitalOcean and have more of a focus on the application.

In the early stages of the course, virtual machines were provisioned using Vagrant with a DigitalOcean provider and configured via a `provision.sh` script. In the latter half of the course, the group migrated over to OpenTofu and Ansible for configuration management. The reason for this change to Ansible was that we were able to use Ansible's Vault for storing environment variable instead of having a `.env` file which had to manually edited on each computer as to not accidentally publish keys or other confidential information. In addition to this, we also migrated from Vagrant to Ansible was due to readability. Our `provision.sh` got cluttered due to a lot of if-statements (hence why we turned to Ansible for the idempotency).

### Dependencies

The diagram below shows the dependencies across the project such as build tools, libraries and images for docker containers.

![Dependency](images/dependency-diagram.svg)

`Minitwit-java` uses the `pom.xml` file for managing its dependencies whereas the Svelte frontend uses npm (node package manager) to manage its dependencies. The infrastructure of the VMs is being handled by Terraform which creates the necessary droplets and volumes (for data storage) through the `main.tf` script - Ansible is then provisioning each machine with `base.yml` - installing all the shared dependencies across nodes - and then, depending on the VM, provisions the VM with either `swarm.yml`, `db.yml`, `monitoring.yml`. Then the final *playbook* `deploy.yml` deploys the docker swarm/stack.

By using OpenTofu in conjunction with Ansible, we have been able to more easily provision each machine an ensure idempotency across the nodes. This also has provided us with an more streamlined approach to initialising new machines.

# Process Perspective

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Github Workflows | CI/CD as code

GitHub Actions was chosen for its native integration with our existing GitHub repository, eliminating the need for a separate CI/CD service. While alternatives such as Jenkins or Forgejo offer self-hosted execution and faster feedback loops, the operational overhead of maintaining additional infrastructure outweighed the benefits at our scale. The pipeline implements continuous deployment: every push to main that touches application code is automatically tagged, tested, built, and deployed to production without manual intervention, as illustrated in the activity and sequence diagrams. Tests act as the deployment gate, meaning a failing test job would block the build and deploy stages from running. A dry-run workflow on test/** branches allowed us to validate infrastructure changes safely before merging.

## Monitoring Architecture and Data Flow

### Dashboard Structure Basic Model

Our monitoring setup consists of three components:

- Application - Javalin app - produces metrics
- Prometheus - collects and stores metrics over time
- Grafana - visualizes metrics

### How metrics are stored (labels + time)

Each metric is not just one value.
It is split into multiple counters based on labels, and each of those is tracked over time.

### Labels (different counters)

When we define:

```
.labelNames("method", "path", "status")
```

we are creating a separate counter for each combination of method, path and status so at one point in time, the application exposes:

```
minitwit_http_requests_total{method="GET",  path="/api/msgs",  status="200"} = 10
minitwit_http_requests_total{method="POST", path="/api/msgs",  status="200"} = 5
minitwit_http_requests_total{method="GET",  path="/api/fllws", status="404"} = 2
```

Each of these is its own counter. Prometheus calls /metrics repeatedly every 15 seconds and stores the values as such:

```
(GET, /api/msgs, 200)
00:00 -> 5
00:15 -> 7
00:30 -> 10

(POST, /api/msgs, 200)
00:00 -> 2
00:15 -> 3
00:30 -> 5
```

For every label combination, Prometheus stores a timeline of values. Many counters (labels). Each with its own history - hence each unique set of labels creates its own time series that Prometheus tracks over time.

### How Queries Work

Prometheus stores all collected snapshots as a time series `[100, 120, 150, ...]`
Historical data is created by Prometheus repeatedly sampling the application.
Functions like: `rate(minitwit_http_requests_total[5m])` work by comparing stored values over time: `(150 - 120) / time`

This allows Prometheus to compute:

- request rate (requests per second)
- trends over time
- error rates etc

### Role of Grafana

Grafana does not store or compute metrics it queries Prometheus then visualizes the returned time series data. The system works because of the following separation:

- Application - only knows the current value
- Prometheus - builds history by sampling repeatedly

Without Prometheus, there is no history
Without history, there are no rates or trends

### Logging Architecture and Data Flow

**How logs are stored**

Logs are not numeric values like metrics but textual events describing what happens in the system. Each log entry represents a specific event such as an error, request, or system message.
The application produces logs using a logger, for example:

```
log.error(...)
log.info(...)
```

At one point in time, the application may produce logs such as:

```
User login failed for user X
Request to /api/msgs returned 500
User Y followed user Z
```

Each of these is an individual log entry.
Loki collects these logs and stores them over time, similar to how Prometheus stores metrics, but without aggregating them into numeric values.

**How logs are queried**
Logs are stored as a timeline of events rather than a sequence of numbers.
Instead of computing rates or averages, logs are queried to:

- find specific events
- trace errors
- understand what happened at a given point in time

**Loki's Role of Grafana**
Grafana queries Loki and visualizes logs in a searchable format.
The system works because of the following separation:

- Application - produces log messages
- Loki - builds history by storing logs over time

## Security

### Git Break In {#git-break-in}

**Risk level:** High (Impact: High, Probability: Medium.)

**Description:** If a team member's GitHub account is compromised, an attacker can grant themselves admin rights, push malicious code, and approve pull requests.

**Mitigation & Scenarios:** We enforce two-factor authentication and restrict admin privileges through RBAC, including a super-admin role.

### Java Dependencies {#java-dependencies}

**Risk level:** High (Impact: High, Probability: Medium.)

**Description:** Our system relies heavily on the Javalin framework and third-party libraries for all endpoints and HTTP(S) traffic.

**Mitigation & Scenarios:** We keep all dependencies updated to stable versions and monitor for known vulnerabilities.

### Java Database {#java-database}

**Risk level:** Medium (Impact: Medium, Probability: Medium.)

**Description:** We use JOOQ ORM and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to interact with the database, which can introduce SQL-related risks.

**Mitigation & Scenarios:** We avoid raw SQL concatenation and ensure all database-related libraries are kept up to date.

### Digital Ocean {#digital-ocean}

**Risk level:** High (Impact: High, Probability: Medium.)

**Description:** Deletion of droplets or volumes can lead to downtime and data loss.

**Mitigation & Scenarios:** We perform daily backups and use Terraform to recreate infrastructure if resources are deleted.

### Node Modules (NPM) {#node-modules}

**Risk level:** Medium (Impact: Medium, Probability: Medium.)

**Description:** Third-party Node dependencies may introduce vulnerabilities or be compromised through supply chain attacks.

**Mitigation & Scenarios:** We audit dependencies (e.g. npm audit), keep packages updated, and review new additions carefully.

### UFW {#ufw}

**Risk level:** High (Impact: High, Probability: Medium.)

**Description:** If the firewall is misconfigured, unnecessary ports may be exposed. Docker port mappings can bypass firewall rules.

**Mitigation & Scenarios:** We deny incoming traffic by default, allow only required ports, restrict SSH access, and ensure Docker does not bypass UFW.

# Reflection Perspective

Through the course of the semester we adhered to the weekly schedule and as the complexity of the project grew we hit issues covered in the lectures almost exactly as expected with the unique challenge being deciding how to solve our issue. The best example was during the migration to the new swarmed archetecture. 

During migration, we decided to copy the database over manually so we could be sure that we had all of the data in the new database before pointing the load balanacer at the five droplet archetecture. This solved the issue we had faced before when we migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL (PR #39, c67392d) where we lost all of our data. However, that introduced a new issue where we copied the old version of the database ```bash docker exec -i <containername> pg_restore --clean -U <postgresuser> -d <databasename> < /tmp/backup.dump ``` this code copied not just the data but also the existing indexes and tables. this would have been fine, great in-fact, but it circumvented the schema.sql code being the zone of truth. There was a difference between the simulator_state table on the server and the on in our schema.sql which caused a bug as soon as we started handling api requests on the new system. Because of the observability we had set up, the grafana dashboards were able to help us debug the issue. 
![alt text](images/getLatestError.png)
Corbjin saw the latestID bottom out and quickly fixed the database to give the state_key a unique constraint which helped resolved the issue.

(52f78a3,6bb1f4b,116b4c0,975ccbd,06cca45,aaa719c,ecc2934,...)
The more profound and pervasive issue we faced can be found peppered through our commit history the overhead of five developers sharing one codebase, one deployment target, and no stardardized system for managing credentials or local environments. We tried devcontainers early on but that didn't solve our needs. Magnus spent time trying to organize the .env file so that each of our public keys were put on Digital Ocean and that worked somewhat but our keys were hardcoded for a bit in the beginning. introducing Ansible and OpenTofu made a big difference and storing secrets in the vault was so much easier to debug and plan for. This however means that we would need to find a way to share access to the state file so that anyone on the team could run the ansible playbooks however this was out of the scope for our goals with the project.

What this project did differently from previous development work was treat infrastructure, deployment, and operations as first-class engineering concerns rather than end-of-project chores. From week three we introduced the CI/CD pipline (de742b3), infrastructure as code, version-controlled dashboards (24aff3c), and automated semantic versioning (ea74933). These payed dividends when issues arose because they shortened the distance between a problem occurring in production and a developer understanding why. The Grafana dashboard catching the latestID bug during migration is the clearest proof of that.

-->

## Tools used

Throughout the project we used **Claude** (Anthropic), **ChatGPT** (OpenAI), **Gemini** (Google), and **GitHub Copilot** as coding assistants.

## How they were used

We've been using AI as a sparring partner throughout the whole project. It was something we could discuss our ideas with and ask questions like "why does this not work?". We also used it as a coding assistant, and we had a setup on GitHub with Copilot that helped us clean up the code and catch bad patterns or potential bugs before they made it in.

All generated code was read, tested, and adapted before being committed.

## Reflection

We all come from the Software Design programme and took this course in our second semester, so the learning curve was a bit steep. Despite some prior production experience in the group, we leaned on AI tools to explain the system, walk us through the components we had to implement, and act as a coding assistant.

Looking back, the tools clearly accelerated how quickly we could implement and understand things, but the trade-off was that we sometimes skipped the exercises and went straight into implementing on the project. If we did something similar again, we would probably spend more time working through the exercises first and only then move on to the project implementation. Because AI output always looks like it has the answer, we also over-relied on it at times. Towards the end of the project we got better at discussing problems in the group and putting them on the whiteboard rather than turning to an AI first, and that approach really helped us land a good setup for our Docker Swarm migration.
